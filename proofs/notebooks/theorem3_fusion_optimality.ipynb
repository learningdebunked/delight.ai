    "# Theorem 3: Fusion Optimality\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statement\n",
    "The cultural fusion process in Delight.AI's SEDS achieves optimal blending of cultural dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formal Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Problem Formulation\n",
    "Given cultural profiles $C_1, C_2, ..., C_n$, find the optimal fusion $C^*$ that minimizes:\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \\cdot d(C, C_i)^2$$\n",
    "where $d(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is the cultural distance metric and $w_i$ are weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Optimality Proof\n",
    "The optimal fusion $C^*$ is given by the weighted mean:\n",
    "$$C^* = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i C_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This minimizes the weighted sum of squared distances, as shown by solving the first-order optimality condition."
