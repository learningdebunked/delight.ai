## 🎮 Real-world Simulation Examples

### 1. Smart Queue Management System

Delight.AI transforms traditional queue management with emotional intelligence and predictive analytics:

#### Core Features:
- **Real-time Mood Tracking**: 
  ```python
  # Tracks customer mood states
  class CustomerMood(Enum):
      CALM = "😊"      # Happy to wait
      IMPATIENT = "😐"  # Starting to get restless
      FRUSTRATED = "😠" # Noticeably unhappy
      ANGRY = "👿"     # At risk of leaving
  ```
- **Adaptive Staff Allocation**:
  - Automatically adjusts staffing based on queue metrics
  - Prioritizes customers showing signs of frustration
  - Suggests optimal queue configurations in real-time

#### Technical Implementation:
```python
def generate_mitigation_strategy(analytics):
    strategies = []
    
    # Dynamic staffing adjustments
    if analytics['average_wait'] > timedelta(minutes=10):
        strategies.append("Open additional checkout counters")
        strategies.append("Deploy mobile checkout assistants")
    
    # Customer experience interventions
    if analytics['mood_distribution'].get('frustrated', 0) > 2:
        strategies.append("Offer complimentary refreshments")
        
    return strategies if strategies else ["Queue conditions optimal"]
```

3. **During Wait**
   - Monitors preparation time
   - Sends proactive updates if delay detected
   - For special orders: "Adding the finishing touches to make it perfect!"

#### Technical Implementation:
```python
def handle_curbside_arrival(customer, order):
    # Analyze order emotional significance
    is_special = any(keyword in order['items'] 
                    for keyword in ['cake', 'birthday', 'anniversary'])
    
    # Get customer's cultural preferences
    cultural_profile = get_cultural_profile(customer.id)
    
    # Generate context-appropriate response
    return generate_response(
        context={
            'order_type': 'special' if is_special else 'standard',
            'wait_time': estimate_prep_time(order),

   # Initialize the client
   delight = DelightAI()
   ```

3. **Start enhancing customer experiences**:
   ```python
   # Example: Analyze customer sentiment
   analysis = delight.analyze_sentiment(
       text="I've been waiting for 15 minutes!",
       customer_id="cust_123"
   )
   
   if analysis.urgency > 0.7:
       print("⚠️ High-priority attention needed!")
```
